 * steps :

 # API Calls:

 In General we make API Calls inside componentDidMount(). So that it doesnâ€™t block render().

# Fetch
fetch is a promise-based API which returns a response object. In the backend, we use snake_case for naming conventions.

# Route Props
When a component is rendered by the Route, some additional props are passed

* match
* location
* history

# Match
The match object contains the information about the path from which the component is rendered.
